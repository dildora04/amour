                <h1>Resume</h1>
                <p>Responsibilities should be formulated in such a way that potential employers see the results of your work. For persuasiveness, use numbers and give specific examples. For example:
                    - Was engaged in wholesale sales of computer equipment and electronics. Among the clients are such companies as MTS, VTB, Novatek.
                    — Daily identified the needs of clients by negotiating on the phone and in person with the first persons of small and medium-sized businesses. Made more than 70 cold calls per day, more than 3 face-to-face meetings per week.
                    — Carried out calls to the existing customer base (50 calls per day with a norm of 30) in order to offer new services (components, after-sales service), which allowed us to increase profit by 25% in 2016 compared to 2015.
                    — Thanks to effective presentations, we managed to attract 10 new clients, including 3 especially large ones (MegaFon, Superjob, Tander).
                    — Conducted more than 300 negotiations with potential clients in 2016, 280 of which ended in the successful signing of contracts for a total of 19 million rubles.
                    
                    In the "Achievements" section, tell us about your professional successes. It is important to describe them specifically, preferably using some measurable indicators. For example: “During my work in the company, the level of sales of climate equipment has grown by 170%”; “Within a year, the loyal customer base has doubled.”
                    
                    The block "Key skills" involves listing your core competencies. This is where you can highlight your professionalism. Here is an example of a successful description of the applicant's key skills:
                    - experience as a sales manager - 5 years;
                    – excellent knowledge of the market of computer equipment, office equipment and consumables;

                    - knowledge of technologies and methods of wholesale sales.
                    
                    In the "Additional Information" field, indicate the information that is important for working in the desired position. It would be nice to give an example of how your personal qualities help you in your work. For example: "Communication skills and the ability to interest listeners help me to make effective presentations." Other important qualities for a sales manager can be stress resistance, energy, activity, focus on results, initiative, competent speech, easy learning, enthusiasm, ambition.
